# MIT Project: PacMan.

MIT Web Development Week 7 Project. 

In the Week 7 project, we simulated a game type application to make a PacMan and navigate between page boundaries. We also allowed functions to duplicate/multiply PacMan, while enabling various speeds of accelteration.

## How to run:

- Download PacMan files from the folder.
- Run the HTML file on a compatible browser.
- Click on "Start Game" button.
- Click "Add PacMan"
- After these steps, you can click "Add PacMan" as much as you want, to add additional PacMan to the screen. Clicking faster will change acceleration of individual units. 

    
## Roadmap for future improvements:

- Optimize the movement animation.

- Implement more characters, such as "ghosts".

- Add "pellets" and "power cookies".
